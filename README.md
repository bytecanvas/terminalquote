# How to use QuoteTab on every new terminal tab

You donâ€™t want the infinite loop to freeze your terminal on startup â€” so the best way is to show **one random quote each time you open a new tab** and then return you to your prompt.

---

### Step 1: Save the script as `~/tab_quote.sh` (modifying the infinite loop to show just **one** quote and exit):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

quotes=(
  "Push yourself â€” because no one else is going to do it for you."
  "Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer."
  "You donâ€™t need a new plan, you need to stay consistent with the current one."
  # ... (include all 100 quotes here)
  "The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time."
)

random_index=$((RANDOM % ${#quotes[@]}))

echo
echo "ðŸ’¬ Quote of the Tab:"
echo
echo "\"${quotes[$random_index]}\""
echo
```

---

### Step 2: Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x ~/quote_tab.sh
```

---

### Step 3: Add it to your shell config file

* For **bash** (`~/.bashrc`), add at the end:

```bash
# Show a random quote on every new terminal tab
bash ~/quote_tab.sh
```

* For **zsh** (`~/.zshrc`), add:

```bash
# Show a random quote on every new terminal tab
bash ~/quote_tab.sh
```

---

### Done!

Every time you open a new terminal tab, youâ€™ll see a fresh quote before your prompt appears.
